# To Do List
Minimal to do list for all users

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal to-do-list for all users.

I wanted a to do list of my own for daily purposes and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point. Simple and Easy.

SO I sat down one day and created this # TO do List.
Feel free to fork, clone, play around and make this your own.
